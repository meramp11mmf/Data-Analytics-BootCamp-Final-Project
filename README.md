## Introduction  
The dataset includes information on patient demographics, satisfaction scores, and hospital administrative details. Key insights derived from this project aim to support decision-making, resource allocation, and policy formulation for improved patient care and operational efficiency.

---

## Data Sources  
The analysis is based on a hospital dataset with 1,077 entries and 12 columns, including:  
- Patient ID  
- Gender  
- Age  
- Satisfaction Score  
- Race  
- Wait Time  

Data preparation involved cleaning the dataset by eliminating missing values and duplicates.

## Analysis Tasks  

### Task 1: Patient Demographics Analysis  
- **Objective:** Understand gender, race, and age distributions within the patient population.  
- **Key Insights:**  
  - Gender distribution is balanced with 495 females and 580 males.  
  - Racial distribution shows White patients as the largest group, followed by African American and Two or More Races.  
  - The average age is approximately 39.81 years, with a significant concentration of younger patients.  

### Task 2: Hospital Admission Trends  
- **Objective:** Identify patterns and trends in hospital admissions over time.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Time-series analysis of admissions grouped by day, week, and month.  
  - Seasonal patterns and peak admission periods visualized using line charts.  

### Task 3: Patient Satisfaction Analysis  
- **Objective:** Evaluate satisfaction scores across hospital departments.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Used Tableau to create interactive dashboards with heatmaps and filters for dynamic data exploration.  
  - Aggregated satisfaction scores to identify trends by department.  

### Task 4: Operational Efficiency Analysis  
- **Objective:** Assess patient wait times and surgery durations.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Built Power BI dashboards to visualize efficiency metrics.  
  - Developed KPIs and gauges to evaluate performance against targets.  

---

## Recommendations  
- Allocate resources to departments with lower satisfaction scores to improve patient experience.  
- Monitor seasonal admission trends to prepare for peak periods effectively.  
- Optimize operational processes to reduce patient wait times and improve efficiency.
